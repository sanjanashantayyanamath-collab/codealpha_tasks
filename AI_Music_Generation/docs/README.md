# AI Music Generation Tool ðŸŽµ

## Description
This project is an **AI-based Music Generation Tool** developed for the CodeAlpha Internship. It uses algorithmic composition principles implemented in JavaScript to create a simple, random melody. The tool plays the music using the Web Audio API and allows the user to download the generated sequence data as a JSON file.

## Features
* **Algorithmic Generation:** Creates a unique random melody sequence using JavaScript logic.
* **Web Audio Playback:** Plays the generated music directly in the browser using the **Tone.js** library.
* **Sequence Download:** Allows saving the generated note data as a **JSON file** (as an alternative to complex MIDI creation).
* **Interactive Controls:** Includes buttons to start, stop, and download the music.

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS
* **Key Library:** Tone.js (imported via CDN)
* **API Used:** Web Audio API
